## Content Delivery Network (CDN) - Repositories

Each application is offered by different mirrors and repositories, so including all of them would be impossible and unnecessary, these are the main mirrors for the repository updates.

```
fdroid.tetaneutral.net
mirrors.dotsrc.org
dotsrc.org
guardianproject.info
```
