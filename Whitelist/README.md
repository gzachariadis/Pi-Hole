# Introduction

This is a list of websites, services and applications I whitelist under my configuration.

**Follow at your own peril.**

A checkbox next to an item means that website of application has passed it's "vetting" (for lack of a better word)

Vetting Process

1. Research each URL the application connects to, in order to determine it's functionallity.
2. Use the Audit tool to search for it inside my Adlists. Multiple matches is a red flag.
3. Approve it, then blacklist it again, and generally, play around with different configuration.
4. Test the configuration under different scenarios, eg. login, change settings, different devices etc.
5. Settle on the most minimal configuration which works.
6. Done!

Enjoy! :)
