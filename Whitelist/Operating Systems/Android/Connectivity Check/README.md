<h1 align="center">Android Connectivity Check</h1>
<h3 align="center">This method checks whether mobile is connected to internet and returns true if connected.</h3>

The reason I whitelist it, it's because in unrooted devices, some apps require a connectivity check to function; [example](https://github.com/AntennaPod/AntennaPod/issues/6899#issuecomment-1913233071), also some devices, show the no-internet icon for most WiFi connections.
