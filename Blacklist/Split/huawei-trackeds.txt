# Huawei smartphone DNS blocking list by ftpihole - https://www.ftpihole.com/

# Huawei Android phones do not seem to exchange much data in the background, but if you are paranoid, here is a list to block what they do connect with.
# Huawei's own apps seem to still work fine with this list applied basted on my testing.
# If you have a Huawei phone that still has Google services, no this list will not break them.

# Designed for and tested on the Pi Hole but should work on all DNS based filters including Android apps such as AdAway, AdGuard, DNS66, etc...
